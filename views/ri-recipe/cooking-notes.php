<h1>Cooking Meals</h1>

<p>Meal Prep - When to cook, and how many servings to cook.</p>
<p>Best way is cook lunch and dinner, on the same day, or at the least the very next day.</p>
<p>Best to cook 3 servings at a time.</p>

<h2>Schedule</h2>

<p>Tuesdays / Wednesdays / Thursdays are the best days to cook.</p>
<p>Sometimes I get busy.</p>
<p>Best to find a day when I can cook lunch and dinner that day, and once more the next day.</p>
<p>Tuesdsay - Lunch and Dinner, Wednesday - Lunch is what you're trying to do, which will last through Saturday Lunch.</p>
<p>Ideally, cook one more meal either on Thursday or Friday, and then it will last through Sunday Dinner.</p>

<h2>Things to Consider</h2>

<h3>Is Light Sprint / Difficulty of Dishes</h3>

<p>If its a Light Sprint</p>
<p>Difficulty of Dishes doesn't need to matter.</p>
<p>Its not a light sprint?</p>
<p>Have some easy dishes, some hard.</p>

<h3>Expensive or Cheap</h3>

<p>Regardless, I always want to save some money. Not all meals should be expensive.</p>
<p>I need to know cost of recipes, calculated by what ingredients I already have, once I know the price of ingredients.</p>
<p>Expensive / Tasty dishes can mostly come from Home Chef.</p>
<p>Cheap dishes can come from two books I bought, and Delish.com website.</p>

<h3>Variety / Digestion</h3>

<p>I get tired of the same things all the time, but a lot of stuff is hard to digest.</p>
<p>Best way to get variety is to vary the types of protein (fish / steak / pork / turkey / chicken), and different sub-types of protein (salmon / whitefish</p> / meatballs / types of steak)
<p>Other best way is to vary the cooking methods - Stovetop, Oven (Tovala Oven), Gas Grill, Pressure Cooker, Slow-cooker.</p>
<p>Another best way is the style of cooking - Mexican, Italian, Seafood, Asian, American.</p>

<h3>Tasty / Agreeable</h3>

<p>Tips: Grilling makes meat taste better.</p>
<p>Oven (Tovala) Baked makes veggies and starch taste better.</p>

<h3>Meal Planning</h3>

<p>Cooking starts on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday.</p>
<p>Shopping happens on Thursday / Friday / Saturday. Buy everything but meat on Thursday or Friday.</p>
<p>Always buy meat on Saturday to have for Tuesday.</p>
<p>When get home on Thursday and Friday, data-enter the price of the ingredients for the app.</p>
<p>Meal planning starts on Wednesday preferably, sometimes on Thursday. This means we always start planning out the next week, the second day into once</p> cooking has started.
<p>Wednesdays and Thursdays are good days to strategize all this stuff.</p>

<h3>Tips</h3>

<p>Shopping at Marketplace is easier</p>
<p>Get Tovala and Tovala Oven</p>
<p>Clean off old grill</p>

<h3>Need More Cooking Appliances</h3>

<p>Couple more cast iron skillets (not too large, too heavy)</p>
<p>Food Processor</p>
<p>Bigger Instant Pot</p>

<h2>What Metrics I Need</h2>

<h3>Price</h3>

<p>As I said before, I need to know cost of recipes, calculated by what ingredients I already have, once I know the price of ingredients.</p>

<h3>Is Tasty</h3>

<p>New field in database</p>

<h3>Difficulty</h3>

<p>New field in database - Hard / Medium / Easy</p>

<h3>Style</h3>

<p>Mexican, Italian, Seafood, Asian, American.</p>

<h2>How To Implement</h2>

<p>Need to add 3 other fields to database - Is Tasty / Difficulty - Hard / Medium / Easy, Style - Mexican, Italian, Seafood, Asian, American.</p>
<p>Need PWA for data-entry of these 4 things (price is 4th field)</p>
<p>Need PWA - Data Table to filters and multi-sort.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>Do the necessary app work needed for this</p>
<p>Clean off old grill</p>
<p>Save up for Tovala</p>
<p>When it starts getting hot again - order Tovala</p>
<p>Plan out when to start this schedule, and think about things that go on during the week</p>
